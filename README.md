# MITACS
In this repository, there will be an overview of the application procedure and selection. So the [MITACS](https://www.mitacs.ca/en/programs/globalink/globalink-research-internship) application opens around August till mid-to-late September. Students who are eligible have to be in 3rd or 4th year of undergraduate in partnered university. Other details and technicalities can be found on their website and I'm just mentioning an overview of how it goes. 

So the portal opens for like a month and a half, where you have to submit 
1. Complete [application](https://github.com/Mansi130101/MITACS/blob/d44a95313b5b4826a969db85be19fe557dd69662/MITACS_Application.pdf)
2. 2 LORs (Letter of Recommendation) **at least 1
3. Resume/[CV](https://github.com/Mansi130101/MITACS/blob/d44a95313b5b4826a969db85be19fe557dd69662/Mansi_CV.pdf)
4. Official Transcript (Interim Grade Card)
5. [SOP](https://github.com/Mansi130101/MITACS/blob/d44a95313b5b4826a969db85be19fe557dd69662/Mansi_SOP.pdf) (Statement of Purpose)

For me, my CG was 9+, had 4 projects (with 1 published and 2nd on its way), 2 internships, and 2 LORs (IITKGP, DEAKIN UNIV.).

Some key points are that:-
1. reach out to profs for LOR as soon as the application starts, as then even they will have time to write something specific to you rather than any general template.
2. ask those profs whom you have worked with on research projects or have been standing out in their course, to have a personal connection wrt LOR.
3. for SOP, limit to 1 page and write about how you started, what are your future aspirations, why this project is in your interest, and why you are the best fit. I uploaded my SOP at the time of application to have a better idea.
4. preferably complete and submit your application at least 1 week before the deadline this shows a quite regular and promising profile as the amount of application is huge.
5. if you are planning for MITACS think: do you want research exposure, do you feel interested in exploring foreign cultures and making a network? if so you should try keeping your CG high and have some research projects started with, to build your background.
6. for a transcript you will have to ask your university for an official transcript. for IITKGP there is an option of applying for an interim grade card and for that, you pay 25rupees.
7. you can make your cv even before the application portal opens, this will lessen the burden and stress during that phase as you would then concentrate on other things needed.
8. so you have to apply for at most 7 projects with different univ., city, and some other specifications which you can look up. so once the portal opens among those numerous uploaded projects you need to filter down wrt your topic of interest, university ranking, and professor H-index.
9. while shortlisting keep in mind that you need to keep it diverse like keeping some univ. that are top-rated and some not so good, at least ensuring your selection among the lesser-ranked univ. projects.
10. once the interviewing starts: it depends on each prof. they may or may not interview for selection. I was selected for my 2nd preference which I wasn't even interviewed for and it all goes in a preference order. You will also have time around December-January when you can start getting selected.

With my application, I was selected for Univ of Alberta project on the application of AI-ML in the medical domain.
Unfortunately, I had different plans for my 3rd-year summer and I informed the prof about my unavailability. Other friends of mine who were also selected had a great time and learning exposure in Canada. In all, it is a great opportunity that I wish I had not missed!
